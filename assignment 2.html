        - It's impossible to be active on all the social media channels, so you have to select the ones that make the most sense for your business. In order do that, you need a high level overview of the platforms that exist and how they might benefit you. Now, there are many socia media brands. Some are big and have been around for a while, some are smaller and they may be newer too. There are networks that are focused on the general audience, and then there are some niche social networks that focus on bringing people together who have similar interests. The social media landscape can be divided up in a few categories. Here's a popular categorization by Fred Cavazza. He categorizes the social media platforms in networking, publishing, sharing, messaging, discussing and collaborating platforms. And while it's true that most brands are mainly focused, or have their origins, in one of these functions, these days you'll find that the most popular and biggest platforms touch on all of these aspects. Take Facebook for instance, which started out as a networking and sharing platform, but now also has messaging tools, groups, Facebook Watch and more. Clearly, there are many social media brands, but as a marketer, you should go where your customer is. Here's Hootsuite's overview of the biggest social networking platforms and their global audiences. The chart breaks out the messenger applications, which are shown in red, and the social sharing platforms in orange. Facebook dominates the social landscape with not only Facebook, but also its messaging tools, WhatsApp and Messenger. Instagram, also owned by Facebook, has a smaller audience, but it's definitely important. WeChat, QQ, and Qzone dominate in China, with larger audiences and high user engagement. TikTok, a Chinese made app known in China as Douyin lets users create and share online videos using all kinds of special effects. TikTok has grown fast. It particularly appeals to younger audiences. Reddit, a content aggregation and discussion website lets users post and share and rate content categorized by topic and interest. Twitter, Pinterest and Snapchat are much smaller platforms than say Facebook, but their audiences are still substantial. Different products appeal more or less to different age groups. YouTube and Facebook are used by people of almost any age group. 60% of people between the ages of 18 and 29 use Snapchat, but Snapchat sees little uses from older age groups. Instagram also skews younger, but we do see 40% of people between the ages of 30 and 49 using the platform as well. Twitter reaches a much smaller audience overall, with a skew towards the younger age group. LinkedIn sees slightly more adoption among the 30 to 49 year olds, an effect of its specific focus on a professional audience. Pinterest, while smaller, has an equal reach among the under 30 and under 40 audiences. When it comes to gender, YouTube, LinkedIn and Twitter have a pretty similar reach among men and women. Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram all skew slightly female. Pinterest is a clear outlier with 41% reach among women and only 16% reach among men. When deciding on the channels you're going to invest in, it's important to also take a look at how intense their usage is. YouTube and Facebook see the most intense use from their audiences, with users spending on average 40 or 35 minutes per day respectively on these platforms. Snapchat and Instagram follow. Time spent on LinkedIn and Pinterest is lower, but still substantial. Twitter however sees very limited interaction from its user base on average. It's good to keep this high level overview in mind just to start planning your digital marketing strategy. When you select the channels you'll use to connect with your customers, this information matters. After all, you want to make sure that your message lands with the right audience on a platform where they may pay attention to it.
